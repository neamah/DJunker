# DJunker
Prompt you to remove old files or random files from your system to help keep it clean and de-junked.

Current stage:
-Only looking in the Downloads directory, since that seems to be the most cluttered for me. I'll be adding
code to make it look in other directories too.
-Randomly chooses between giving you a random file or the oldest file.
